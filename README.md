# tweet-anonymizer
A bookmarklet that can make it easier to take anonymous Twitter screenshots

When used on Twitter, this will replace @usernames with Alice, Bob, etc. This can be useful when you want to take a screenshot of a long conversation but don't want to expose the names of the participants.

### TODO
Accept a set of names not to convert
Also convert display name
